# Monstershuffler
New frontend application for [monstershuffler.com](https://www.monstershuffler.com) 

The purpose of this new version is to create a repository which is easy to understand, maintain and improve by me and other developers.

( this project is still very incomplete, but you can check its progress if you want to )

## Dependencies and tools used
- [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/) a well-rounded frontend JavaScript framework
- [**TypeScript**](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) an CSS extension language
