    <p class="static">
      What's the use of dynamic stat blocks if we can't take full advantage of
      them in combat? The Combat Manager will be a key tool for Dungeon Masters,
      designed to be opinionated and minimalistic. It focuses on providing only
      the most relevant information at any moment, leaving unnecessary stats to
      the players and hiding anything not immediately needed.
    </p>
    <p class="static">
      Monstershuffler's dynamic stat blocks make it possible to track each
      monster's available actions in real time. For example, during a player's
      turn, the Combat Manager shows only a monster's available reactions,
      giving DMs the option to mitigate attacks. On the monster's turn, it
      displays all actions and abilities they can now use, streamlining
      decision-making.

    <h3 class="static mt-4">Key Features of the Combat Manager:</h3>
    <ul class="static">
      <li>
        <em>Minimalistic Interface</em>: Display only what the DM needs at any
        given moment, leaving character-related details to the players.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Optional Resource Tracking</em>: Track used spells, actions, and
        other monster resources. Disable this feature for an even simpler
        experience.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Integrated Dice Rolls</em>: Roll any monster ability, save, or
        damage dice directly within the manager. Condition Tracking: Apply
        conditions to monsters and watch their stats and rolls update in real
        time.
      </li>
    </ul>

      The Combat Manager transforms encounters into a smoother, more intuitive
      experience while keeping the Dungeon Master in control.
