    <!--
    Note groups are designed to help you organize your notes with Dungeon Mastering in mind. I've come up with four unique ways to structure your content:

Maps: Interactive images where you can add markers and labels. Each marker or label links to a note or even another note group! Use maps to define worlds, locations, and dungeons with ease.

Archives: Think of these as OneNote Notebooks: lists of notes organized into Notebooks, Sections, and Notes. Perfect for managing lore-rich campaigns and custom rulesets.

Timelines: Plan the steps of a campaign or adventure with visual timelines. Add branching paths for multiple choices or track the inevitable chaos when your players derail your plans.

Game Sessions: Inspired by The Lazy Dungeon Master by Michael E. Shea, this note group is built for practical gameplay. Create customizable lists of notes for quick links, and use the central outline note (or chain of notes) to guide your session or take notes mid-game.
