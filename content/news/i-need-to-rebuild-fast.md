In my last post, I said my top priority was to rebuild monstershuffler.com as fast as possible. So naturally, I spent the last three weeks... rebuilding the frontend (website) from scratch. Again.

This time, I replaced all my custom components — buttons, forms, inputs, and so on — with the ones from an awesome UI library called [Nuxt UI](https://ui.nuxt.com/).

Sounds counterproductive? Maybe. But here’s the thing: my original components worked, sure, but building them took way too long. And every time I needed something new, I’d fall into the trap of reinventing the wheel — again and again — in the name of uniqueness.

That’s a rookie mistake.

Nuxt UI, on the other hand, is clean, intuitive, and highly customizable. It lets me move faster without sacrificing flexibility or style. Yes, I burned a few weeks swapping things out, but I probably saved myself months of future work. Now I can focus on the parts of the site that actually need my attention: the tools, the experience, the stuff that matters.

Lesson learned: original ≠ custom.
