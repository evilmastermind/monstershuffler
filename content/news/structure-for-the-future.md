![Plan B](/images/news/db-structure.webp)

Over the past week, I’ve been refactoring the database to support some of the new features planned for monstershuffler.com:

- multiple file types (not just stat blocks),
- publishing file bundles,
- and (hopefully someday) collaborative editing and shared content.

Check out the image above for a quick overview of what the new structure looks like.

The goal is to make the foundation both flexible and stable — flexible enough to grow with new ideas, and stable enough to keep development fast and clean, without breaking what already works.

It’s not the most exciting work, but it’s the kind that makes everything else possible.
