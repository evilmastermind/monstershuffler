      <p class="content">
        If you believe your own copyrighted material has been removed from the
        Services as a result of a mistake or misidentification, you may submit a
        written counter notification to the Owner using the contact information
        provided below (a “Counter Notification”). To be an effective Counter
        Notification under the DMCA, your Counter Notification must include
        substantially the following: (1) identification of the material that has
        been removed or disabled and the location at which the material appeared
        before it was removed or disabled; (2) a statement that you consent to
        the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court in which your address is
        located, or if your address is outside Italy, for any judicial district
        in which we are located; (3) a statement that you will accept service of
        process from the party that filed the Notification or the party’s agent;
        (4) your name, address, and telephone number; (5) a statement under
        penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that the material
        in question was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or
        misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled; and (6)
        your physical or electronic signature.
        <br />
        If you send us a valid, written Counter Notification meeting the
        requirements described above, the Owner will restore your removed or
        disabled material, unless he first receive notice from the party filing
        the Notification informing him that such party has filed a court action
        to restrain you from engaging in infringing activity related to the
        material in question. Please note that if you materially misrepresent
        that the disabled or removed content was removed by mistake or
        misidentification, you may be liable for damages, including costs and
        attorney’s fees. Filing a false Counter Notification constitutes
        perjury.

        agreement with him.
        <br />
        The Owner’s failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of
        these Terms of Use shall not operate as a waiver of such right or
        provision. These Terms of Use operate to the fullest extent permissible

        <br />
        The Owner may assign any or all of his rights and obligations to others

        If any provision or part of a provision of these Terms of Use is
        determined to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that provision or
